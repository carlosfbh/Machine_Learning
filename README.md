# Machine_Learning

In this repository I upload exercises performed by me on Machine_Learning problems proposed in Kaggle.

To this day it contains two exercises:

#### 1. Prediction of house prices.
Given a data frame with data on houses, the exercise is about building a model that predicts the price of a house based on its characteristics.
It is a regression exercise.

#### 2. What is cooking. 
A data frame is given in which the ingredients of a dish are indicated and it is said to what kind of cuisine it belongs: Spanish, British, Chinese, Indian, etc ... 
The exercise consists of creating a model that is capable of predicting the type of cuisine depending on the ingredients. It is a classification exercise.
